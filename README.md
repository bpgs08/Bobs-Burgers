# Bob's Restaurant App

## Requirements

* A list/calendar of who is working each day of the week
* A display of who's working on the current day (when I view in my browser)
* A way to edit employee schedules
* A way to create, update, and delete users
* The ability to view, edit, create and delete burgers-of-the-day
* Display the burger-of-the-day for each day of the week
* In a larger font somewhere, the current day's burger-of-the-day
* A way for Bob to set the burger of the day for each day of the week
* A creative and engaging UI/UX

## Getting Started

To get started, just run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Starting the App will kick off two processes: the React App and a simple API. The API is powered by [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). 

The webserver can be accessed at:

- [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The API is proxied and can be found at:

- [http://localhost:3001/burgers](http://localhost:3001/burgers)
- [http://localhost:3001/schedule](http://localhost:3001/schedule)
- [http://localhost:3001/users](http://localhost:3001/users)
